# InfiniteStairway
A random project creating an infinite stairway in Unreal Engine 4, with C++
I also included two separate files which includes a key C++ code, a teleport box



Too many files for me to add Content folder, you can just start a third person example project with C++ base code (+starter content probably) and replace with mine, i added my .umap anyways
